# TeamAI

**Virtual AI Workforce for Digital Marketing Agencies**

TeamAI is a B2B SaaS platform that enables digital marketing agencies to scale infinitely by deploying specialized AI agents as an "inorganic" workforce—eliminating the traditional bottlenecks of hiring costs and physical office space.

## The Problem

Digital marketing agencies face a critical growth challenge: **revenue growth is linearly dependent on the cost of acquiring new human talent and physical infrastructure**. This creates an artificial ceiling on scalability.

## The Solution

TeamAI provides a **Virtual Staffing Marketplace** where agencies can instantly "hire" (subscribe to) AI agents specialized in roles like SEO Specialists, Content Writers, and Lead Qualifiers. These agents are:

- **Immediately deployable** (minutes vs months for human hiring)
- **Dynamically allocatable** (assign to different teams based on workload)
- **Accountable and measurable** (mandatory audit logs, performance tracking)
- **Cost-effective** (multifold savings vs human equivalents with 40%+ platform profit margins)

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Tier Hierarchy

```
Platform (Marketplace)
  └─> Agency (Subscription Management)
       └─> Teams (Agent Operators)
            └─> Agent Instances (Customized Workers)
```

### The "Kitchen" Architecture

**Agents are composed of modular building blocks:**

1. **Data Sources** - External systems (CRMs, Analytics, Databases)
2. **Connectors** - API adapters (HubSpot, Google Analytics, Semrush)
3. **Processors** - Data transformers (LLM wrappers, parsers, analyzers)
4. **Components** - Utilities (Authentication, Rate Limiting, Caching)
5. **Recipes** - Executable workflows (LangGraph DAGs)
6. **Cookbooks** - Capability packages (bundled recipes)
7. **Agents** - Deployed products (1+ Cookbooks + Subscription Tracking)

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Backend** | Python + FastAPI | Async support, lightweight, auto-docs |
| **Agent Framework** | LangChain + LangGraph | Recipe orchestration, DAG workflows |
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript | Industry standard, type safety |
| **Runtime** | Azure Functions (Consumption) | JIT scaling, pay-per-execution |
| **LLM** | Groq (primary), OpenAI (fallback) | Cost efficiency ($0.05-$0.60/1M tokens) |
| **Database** | Self-managed PostgreSQL | ACID compliance, cost optimization |
| **Secrets** | Azure Key Vault | Multi-tenant with agency namespacing |
| **Deployment** | Docker + Azure Container Apps | Flexibility, containerized services |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Free tier, integrated workflows |

**Cost Optimization:** Target 40%+ profit margin through Groq inference, consumption-based Functions, self-managed DB, single Key Vault, free tooling (BeautifulSoup, httpx, pypdf2).

## MVP Scope (1-Month Timeline)

### Initial Agent Offerings

1. **SEO Specialist** - Site audits, broken link checks, meta tag analysis
2. **Social Media Scheduler** - Content generation, trend analysis
3. **Lead Qualifier** - CRM scoring, email drafting

### Core Features

- **Agency Admin Portal** - Marketplace browsing, agent purchase, secret management, billing dashboard
- **Team Config Portal** - Task scheduling, agent interaction, performance monitoring
- **A/B Testing Framework** - Recipe versioning, parallel execution, ML-driven optimization (product differentiator)
- **Subscription Tracking** - Usage metering, audit logging, billing accuracy

### Deferred to Phase 2

- Customer-built cookbooks/recipes
- Modular pricing topups
- Scheduled/cron-based tasks
- Post-execution quality scoring (user ratings)

## Contributing

This project follows a modular architecture enabling parallel development:
- `shared/`: API contracts and schemas (start here)
- `backend/`: Python + FastAPI (independent development)
- `frontend/`: React + TypeScript (independent development)
- `cookbooks/` & `recipes/`: YAML definitions (no code execution)
