## 🎯 Today's Accomplishments (December 17, 2025)

### ✅ AI Agent Fully Working on Azure
1. **SEO Site Audit Agent:**
   - Real Groq API integration (llama-3.1-8b-instant)
   - Crawls target website, extracts SEO data
   - LLM analyzes and generates detailed report
   - Executive summary, critical issues, recommendations
   - ~2 second execution, ~$0.00007 cost

2. **Dashboard Redesigned (3-Panel Layout):**
   - **Left:** Collapsible sidebar with navigation
   - **Center:** Agents/Teams hierarchy + Run SEO Audit
   - **Right:** Subscription info, features, help

3. **Agent UI Enhancements:**
   - URL input field (audit any website)
   - Expand/collapse button for results
   - Real-time metrics display (time, tokens, cost)

4. **Recipe Engine Fixes:**
   - Fixed component signature mismatches (WebCrawler, LLMProcessor, ReportGenerator)
   - Added runtime context for template variables
   - Improved Jinja2 prompt with actual crawl data
   - Report now shows LLM analysis directly

### ✅ Azure Production Deployment - FULLY WORKING
1. **OAuth Flow Verified End-to-End:**
   - User clicks "Sign in with Google" on Azure frontend
   - Redirects to Google OAuth
   - Returns to backend callback with auth code
   - Backend exchanges code for tokens
   - Redirects to frontend with JWT tokens
   - User lands on dashboard - SUCCESS!

2. **Critical Fixes Applied:**
   - **DATABASE_URL encoding:** Password special chars must be URL-encoded (`@` → `%40`, `!` → `%21`)
   - **PostgreSQL firewall:** Added `AllowAzureServices` rule (0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0) for Container Apps access
   - **Redis SSL scheme:** Changed from `redis://` to `rediss://` for TLS on port 6380
   - **Backend env vars:** Added `BACKEND_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` for OAuth redirects

3. **Bootstrap Endpoint Created:**
   - New endpoint: `POST /api/v1/invites/bootstrap`
   - Creates first agency + admin invite in one call
   - Bypasses chicken-and-egg problem for new deployments

4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD:**
   - Auto-deploys on push to main
   - Uses `--no-cache` for frontend builds (ensures env var injection)

### ✅ Documentation Created
- **[docs/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Comprehensive deployment guide with:
  - All critical configuration lessons
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Cost breakdown
  - Bootstrap instructions

- Container Registry: teamairegistry.azurecr.io
- All secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
- Automatic database migrations on startup
- Monthly cost: ~$143 (pre-startup credits)

### 1. Database Models Created
All 11 tables with proper relationships:

**Core Entities:**
- ✅ `agencies` - Top-level tenant (agency_id is everywhere)
- ✅ `teams` - Departments within agencies
- ✅ `users` - Agency admins and team members (role: agency_admin | team_member)

**Agent System:**
- ✅ `agent_roles` - Agent templates (SEO Specialist, Social Media Scheduler, etc.)
- ✅ `cookbooks` - Capability bundles (references agent_roles)
- ✅ `recipes` - Executable workflows (YAML stored as JSONB)
- ✅ `agent_instances` - Deployed agents (custom_name, avatar_icon, configuration)

**Business Logic:**
- ✅ `subscriptions` - Track purchased/allocated/active agents per agency
- ✅ `secret_locker` - Store encrypted API keys (agency-scoped, team-scoped)

**Operations:**
- ✅ `audit_logs` - Execution tracking for billing (tokens, cost, execution time)
- ✅ `task_queue` - Pending/running/completed agent tasks
- ✅ `ab_test_results` - Recipe performance data for ML optimization

### 2. Database Infrastructure
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models with proper types (UUID, JSONB, Numeric)
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with CASCADE/SET NULL
- ✅ Indexes on critical columns (users.email, audit_logs.timestamp, task_queue.created_at)
- ✅ Alembic migration system configured
- ✅ Initial migration generated and applied
- ✅ PostgreSQL running in Docker (teamai-postgres container)

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Features
- ✅ All tables include agency_id for row-level security
- ✅ Teams scoped to agencies (team.agency_id FK)
- ✅ Users scoped to agencies + optional team assignment
- ✅ Secrets can be agency-wide or team-scoped (secret_locker.team_id nullable)
- ✅ Agent instances tied to teams (no cross-team access)

## Database Connection Info
```bash
# Local Docker
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: teamai
User: teamai
Password: teamai_dev_password

# Connection String (already in .env.example)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://teamai:teamai_dev_password@localhost:5432/teamai
```

## Verify Database
```bash
# Check all tables
docker exec teamai-postgres psql -U teamai -d teamai -c "\dt"

# Inspect a specific table
docker exec teamai-postgres psql -U teamai -d teamai -c "\d users"

# List all schemas
cd backend && PYTHONPATH=/workspaces/TeamAI/backend alembic history
```

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Critical (Must Fix Before Scale)
- ⚠️ **No SubscriptionTracker:** Agent executions don't write to audit_logs (billing risk)
- ⚠️ **Architecture Violation:** Connectors mixed into Processors (maintenance nightmare)
- ⚠️ **No Refresh Tokens:** Only 30min access tokens (poor UX, add refresh endpoint)
- ⚠️ **No Rate Limiting:** Components can hit API throttles (need Redis-backed limiter)

### Important (Fix in Phase 2)
- ⚠️ Database migrations run on every restart (add migration lock table)
- ⚠️ No monitoring/alerts configured (add Application Insights)
- ⚠️ No error boundary in frontend (unhandled exceptions crash app)
- ⚠️ Recipe YAML doesn't match architecture diagram (add explicit Connector refs)

### Nice-to-Have (Defer to Phase 3)
- ℹ️ Using Basic tier for Redis and PostgreSQL (upgrade for production scale)
- ℹ️ No custom domain (using *.azurecontainerapps.io URLs)
- ℹ️ No CI/CD pipeline (manual Docker builds/pushes)
- ℹ️ No automated backups for PostgreSQL (add point-in-time restore)

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Today

### Technical Insights
1. **Custom DAG executor > LangChain:** Simpler, faster, no dependency bloat (removed LangChain entirely)
2. **Type coercion matters:** YAML strings don't auto-convert to Python int/float (added explicit handling)
3. **Mock mode essential:** Test without API costs (saved $10+ in development)
4. **Groq is cheap & fast:** $0.000066 for 880 tokens (llama-3.1-8b-instant) vs OpenAI $0.001
5. **Multi-tenant data = moat:** 100K samples/month creates 24+ month competitive advantage

### Strategic Insights
1. **ML is THE differentiator:** Automation is commoditized, intelligence compounds over time
2. **User-visible features matter:** Quality badges > prompt optimization (users see badges, not prompts)
3. **Bootstrap with synthetic data:** Don't wait for real data (generate 1K samples in Week 0)
4. **Network effects dominate:** Each new agency makes ALL agents smarter (Yashus has no network effects)
5. **Recipe generation = game over:** Natural language → YAML is the magical feature competitors can't replicate

### Process Insights
1. **Document before implementing:** ML strategy doc prevents scope creep and misalignment
2. **Test with real API early:** Mock mode masks integration issues (model naming errors)
3. **Architecture compliance matters:** Cutting corners today = technical debt tomorrow
4. **Cost-conscious development:** $300/month ML is expensive until you compare to $400K/month humans (99.9% savings)

## Next Steps (Phase 1b: Auth Backend)

### Create These Files:
1. `backend/app/utils/security.py` - Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT generation
2. `backend/app/models/schemas.py` - Pydantic request/response models
3. `backend/app/api/auth.py` - FastAPI routes: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, GET /auth/me
4. `backend/app/services/auth_service.py` - Business logic (create user, verify password)

### What We'll Build:
- **POST /auth/register** - Create new agency + admin user (atomic transaction)
- **POST /auth/login** - Email/password → JWT token (role in payload)
- **GET /auth/me** - Get current user info (requires JWT)
- **JWT Payload**: `{user_id, email, role, agency_id, team_id?}`

### Tools to Test:
- **Postman**: Manual API testing
- **pytest**: Automated tests in `backend/tests/test_api/test_auth.py`

---

**Status**: Database foundation complete. Ready for auth backend development!
